# Shopping Cart and Inventory System

A console-based application developed in C# that provides a comprehensive interface for both customers and retailers. The application incorporates fundamental programming concepts, including functional programming, speaking assistance, CLI colors, loops, conditions, various data types, and file handling for data persistence.

## Retailer Functionality:

1. **Add New Items to the Inventory:**
   Retailers can easily add new items to the inventory, ensuring an up-to-date and dynamic product list.

2. **View Existing Items:**
   Retailers have the ability to view the existing inventory, making it convenient to monitor available products.

3. **Utilize File Handling for Data Persistence:**
   File handling is employed to persistently store and retrieve data, ensuring that the inventory remains consistent across sessions.

## Customer Functionality:

1. **Access the Inventory and View Items with Prices:**
   Customers can access the inventory to view a list of items along with their corresponding prices.

2. **Select Items and Add Them to the Shopping Cart:**
   Customers can easily select items from the inventory and add them to their shopping cart for convenient and efficient shopping.

3. **Receive Notification for Unavailable Items:**
   A notification through a buzzer is triggered when customers attempt to add an item that is currently unavailable in the inventory.

4. **Benefit from Speech Synthesis for Guidance:**
   Customers receive step-by-step guidance and menu information through speech synthesis, enhancing the user experience.

5. **Receipt Generation at the End of Shopping:**
   Upon completing the shopping process, customers receive a generated receipt summarizing their selected items and the total amount.
